# Boilerplate Application for Chaplin.js

This is a boilerplate applicatoin built with [Chaplin.js](https://github.com/chaplinjs/chaplin), an application structure on top of Backbone.js.

## Running the Example

The original sources are written in CoffeeScript (`coffee/` directory), but this repository already comes with the compiled JavaScripts (`js/` directory). To recompile the CoffeeScripts, you might run the command line [CoffeeScript compiler](http://coffeescript.org/) in the repositoryâ€™s root directory:

```
coffee --bare --output js/ coffee/
```

This repository also contains a copy of the Chaplin library in `js/vendor/chaplin.js`.

### Not a CoffeeScript user?

Chaplin user [cpsubrian](http://github.com/cpsubrian) has translated the
original CoffeeScript source into plain, readable, javascript. You'll find it
in the `plainjs` directory in the ['plain' branch](https://github.com/cpsubrian/chaplin-boilerplate/tree/plain)
of his fork.

## Architectural Documentation

### Directory Structure

This example has a standard Chaplin MVC directory structure:

- `coffee/models`
- `coffee/views`
- `coffee/controllers`
- `coffee/libs`

All vendor libraries like jQuery and Backbone are located `js/vendor/`.

### Application Startup

There are two special files which are responsible for the application bootstrap:

- `coffee/hello_world_application.coffee`
- `coffee/routes.coffee`

`hello_world_application.coffee` is the application root class which inherits from `Chaplin.Application`. It starts up all Chaplin core modules and starts the routing. It is loaded and instantiated in `index.html`.

`routes.coffee` contains all application routes which map URLs to controller actions.

### Templating

Since Chaplin is template-engine agnostic, you have to decide which templating solution you want to use and how you want to load the templates. This example uses [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) templates and loads them on-demand using the [RequireJS Text](http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#text) plugin.

Chaplin expects that views implement the `getTemplateFunction` method which needs to return the actual templating function. Since all views in this example use the same templating solution, `getTemplateFunction` is provided once by two base classes all other views inherit from:

- `coffee/views/base/view.coffee`
- `coffee/views/base/collection_view.coffee`

The actual `.hbs` template files are located in the `js/templates` directory.

### Application-specific Extensions

To ease the development, this repository also provides application-specific base classes for models, collections and controllers. They inherit from the Chaplin base classes:

- `coffee/models/base/model.coffee`
- `coffee/models/base/collection.coffee`
- `coffee/controllers/base/controller.coffee`

Furthermore, `coffee/lib/support.coffee` and `coffee/lib/utils.coffee` demonstrate how to extend the feature testing and utility files of Chaplin.

Last but not least, this example uses a specific `Layout` class which can be found in `coffee/views/utils.coffee`.
